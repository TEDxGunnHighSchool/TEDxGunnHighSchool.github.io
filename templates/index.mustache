          <p>
            In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, <strong>TED</strong> has created a program called <strong>TEDx</strong>. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called <strong>TEDxGunnHighSchool</strong>, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxGunnHighSchool event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
