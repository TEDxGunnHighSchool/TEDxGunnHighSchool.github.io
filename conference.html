          <red>Andrew Dong</red> is the Junior Class Vice President and Site Council Representative at Gunn High School.

          <red>Calvin Lu and Samantha Nguyen</red> both started dancing at UC Berkeley, where they quickly fell in love with the fun, energetic swing dance that is Lindy Hop. Starting their dance careers in Cal’s gender-neutral and “ambidancetrous” dance scene, the two learned to dance as both leaders and followers. Now more involved in the Lindy community than ever, you can find these recent grads teaching together, competing, and working to shift the dance community away from the paradigm where men must lead and women must follow.<br /><br />Samantha and Calvin are excited to share with you their enthusiasm and passion for the swing dance known as Lindy Hop, a partner dance originating from the 1920s and 1930s. They will also talk about improving communities and their efforts to degender the dance and its dance roles.<br /><br />
