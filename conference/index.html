		Each year, TEDxGunnHighSchool aims to center its annual conference's content around a central theme. Previous themes have included <i>Be The Variable, More Than A Number, Trailblazers, Crossroads, New Perspectives, One Step Forward,</i> and <i> Redefining Normal</i>. Our theme this year is focused on a renewed hope as we begin our own hero's journey and are launched forth into a new world post-pandemic. We wanted to provide everyone a series of exciting opportunities and experiences to guide their mindset as they can enter the unknown with new tools and a keen sense of exploration in a newly reformed world. <br /><br />

		With our distinguished set of speakers and performers, we hope to provide a conference experience where the audience will explore innovative ways on how they can reapproach the standard to a better future.
