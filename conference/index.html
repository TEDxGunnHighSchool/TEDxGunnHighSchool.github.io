		Each year, TEDxGunnHighSchool aims to center its annual conference's content around a central theme. Previous themes have included <i>Be The Variable, More Than A Number, Trailblazers, Crossroads, New Perspectives, One Step Forward, Redefining Normal, Call to Adventure,</i> and <i>Blossom</i>. <!-- Our theme this year is focused on a renewed hope as we begin our own hero's journey and are launched forth into a new world post-pandemic. We wanted to provide everyone a series of exciting opportunities and experiences to guide their mindset as they can enter the unknown with new tools and a keen sense of exploration in a newly reformed world. --><br /><br />

		With our distinguished set of speakers and performers, we hope to provide a conference experience where the audience will explore innovative ways on how they can reapproach the standard to a better future.

			Josh Paley is in his 21st year as a Computer Science and Mathematics teacher at Henry M. Gunn HS in Palo Alto, CA where he is fortunate to have lots of smart, hard-working students. He has helped to grow the computer science program there from 50-60 students in 2002—2003 to over 350 in each of the past four years. Josh remains frustrated that the percentage of female and minority students taking computer science is still appallingly low (still around 30%). He thinks that a year of Computer Science should be mandatory to graduate from high school: after all, either you can use a computer to solve problems or you can't, and we are well into the 21st century.

			Josh was one of the pilot instructors for UC-Berkeley's Beauty and Joy of Computing AP CS Principles course. He also served as an instructor for Google's CAPE program in 2010 and 2011. Josh won a national fantasy baseball contest in Y2K and has written about baseball on the side for BaseballHQ.com and Ron Shander's Baseball Forecaster. He is an avid indoorsman as he is allergic to things such as plants, dirt, and probably fresh air. He enjoys board games and poker and is a ferocious Boggle player. Josh has an awesome wife, Suzanne, who does bioinformatics at SRI International, and three amazing kids: Allison, Karen, and Trevor, all of whom are Gunn graduates. He thinks he is very lucky.
