		Each year, TEDxGunnHighSchool aims to center its annual conference's content around a central theme. Previous themes have included <i>Be The Variable, More Than A Number, and Trailblazers</i>. This year, inspired by the convergence (and divergence) of many unexpected paths and ideas in our lives, we decided to choose our theme as <i>Crossroads</i>. <br /><br />

With our distinguished set of speakers and performers, we hope to provide a conference experience where the audience will explore how ideas along different paths intersect, such as artificial intelligence and art, tech startups and non-technical hustlers, happiness and high school, and social media and youth activism.

		<span class="name">Brian Buntz</span>
		<span class="bio">
		  After serving in the Peace Corps in Guatemala in the mid-90's, Brian returned home to California as a middle school teacher. He worked with students recently arrived from Latin America, teaching English as a second language (ESL) and bilingual core-subject classes. Excited by the opportunities that opened up for his students as they developed fluency in a second language, he went on to create a video-based ESL software program that is used throughout the world today to teach beginning English language learners of all ages. In early 2004, Brian joined the team at Dream Careers, Inc., an organization dedicated to providing exceptional hands-on summer career development experiences for college students to serve as its VP of Education.<br /><br />

		  In 2007, he founded Dream Volunteers & Young Dreamer Network, serving at the helm on a pro-bono basis. Since then, Brian has supported over 100 youth internationally with their education and has personally led an average of 12 service trips a year for high school students, college students, and young families interested in making a difference in communities throughout Guatemala, Costa Rica, India, Vietnam and Ghana.<br /><br />

		  Throughout these trips, he has witnessed the transformative power of service, cultural immersion, and self-reflection. Brian developed the personal growth curriculum that students use on the trips to answer questions that young adults often face: Who do I want to be? How can I be deliberate in my decisions, not just letting life's current carry me where it will? What choices can I make that are in alignment with who I want to be? What are the values, interests, passions, and fire that get me out of bed in the morning — and how can I use them to make a real impact?<br /><br />

		  When he's not flying out for a service trip or on the ground in one of our international locations, Brian lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife, Edna, and two young sons, all avid and enthusiastic world travelers. Brian has a Bachelor's degree in Business from the University of Iowa and an MA in Education from San Jose State University. He also holds a multi-subject teaching credential in the State of California.<br /><br />

He attended college at UCLA, where he juggled academics (majoring in Economics), athletics (running on the Track & Field team), and entrepreneurship (starting his own financial brokerage – while still in school!). As a semi-professional runner, he could run a mile race in just 4 minutes and 7 seconds.<br /><br />

		  While in college, Amjed witnessed his older brother, who was somewhat of a child prodigy, build and sell his tech startup to the tech giant Yahoo. He decided at that moment to move to Silicon Valley and pursue his own success in the tech world. But, after a few faltering attempts to replicate his brother’s formula, he learned that his true gift was not for engineering but rather sales.<br /><br />

		  Since then, Amjed has paved his own way in the tech world by focusing on his unique talents. Over the last 4 years, he’s worked at Oracle, Salesforce, and PropelPLM, a fast-growing startup where he was brought in as the first sales hire. Along the way, he’s learned how to develop and maintain a tenacious work ethic, how to build business relationships, and how to succeed in today’s Silicon Valley..<br /><br />
