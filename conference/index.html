		Each year, TEDxGunnHighSchool aims to center its annual conference's content around a central theme. Previous themes have included <i>Be The Variable, More Than A Number, Trailblazers, Crossroads, New Perspectives, One Step Forward,</i> and <i> Redefining Normal</i>. Our theme this year is focused on a renewed hope as we begin our own hero's journey and are launched forth into a new world post-pandemic. We wanted to provide everyone a series of exciting opportunities and experiences to guide their mindset as they can enter the unknown with new tools and a keen sense of exploration in a newly reformed world. <br /><br />

		With our distinguished set of speakers and performers, we hope to provide a conference experience where the audience will explore innovative ways on how they can reapproach the standard to a better future.

      Saara was born and raised in Washington, DC and she relocated to California to do her PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. During this time she struggled with how to approach problem-solving and integrated design thinking to reframe her PhD. From this redefinition, she created several novel medical devices (malaria testing, glucose testing, and urinalysis) that put users at the forefront of her work. She continues to teach PhD students how to integrate design thinking in tackling hard problems and challenges others to reframe how they solve everyday problems with the design process.

Most of our members had little to no previous dance experience, as the club is open to anyone who is interested, regardless of skill level. Through our performance, we hope to showcase the hard work of all of our members, and to spread a love of and appreciation for urban dance.

			Gunn Hip Hop will be performing an original, student-choreographed performance.
