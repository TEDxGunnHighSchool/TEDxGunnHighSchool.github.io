		Each year, TEDxGunnHighSchool aims to center its annual conference's content around a central theme. Previous themes have included <i>Be The Variable, More Than A Number, Trailblazers, Crossroads, and New Perspectives</i>. Inspired by the vision of challenging the norm and viewing established and novel problems under a new light, we selected <i>One Step Forward</i> as this year’s theme. <br /><br />

		With our distinguished set of speakers and performers, we hope to provide a conference experience where the audience will explore innovative ways on how they can take one step forward to a better future.

		<span class="bio">
		  Ishaan Rajan (violin), Jimmy Lee (cello), and Peyton Lee (piano), formed the Fantasma Trio in late 2017. They soon began work on Beethoven’s Ghost Trio, from which the trio’s name is inspired. Since then, they have competed and won on a national level, winning first place at the Silicon Valley Youth Music Competition and the United States International Music Competition. Their future plans include performing in more competitive settings and traveling abroad with their talents as a group.<br /><br />

		  Astor Piazzolla was an Argentinian composer from the 20th century. Born in poverty, he rose to eventually become one of the most prolific Latin American composers in history. His pioneering work on “nuevo tango” popularized the style almost instantly. Adding saxophone, electric guitar, and his personal instrument, the bandoneon, Piazzolla immortalized a jazzy perspective of the tango.<br /><br />

		 Piazzolla’s Libertango, a combination of the words “libertad”, meaning liberty, and “tango”, a type of dance, is perhaps his most recognized work. With their own arrangement, the Fantasma Trio hopes to offer a new perspective on Piazzolla’s masterpiece.<br /><br />

		 Dr. Carreon studied Civil Engineering at UCLA, spending time in a nano-medicine lab and doing nonprofit work in Mexico. Upon graduation, he went to medical school at Stanford where he developed an interest in psychiatry and neuroscience. He started working in a neuroscience lab and studying cognitive behavioral therapy as a medical student, and decided to continue on at Stanford as a psychiatry resident. His research has focused on willpower and "top-down" control, from a naturalistic project looking at self-control "in the wild," to a project trying to increase self-control with brain stimulation, to a gigantic study looking at all the brain imaging studies of executive function in mental illness. Clinically, he is intrigued, challenged, and inspired by his patients with depression. He is working on developing holistic treatments and finding better ways to help his patients thrive, body, brain, and soul. He also loves teaching, nonprofit work (including a year in Kenya), excessively long brunch conversations, and podcasting (http://psyched.space).<br /><br />
